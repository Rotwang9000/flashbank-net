Right... please checkup on where we are with this and see what needs to be done to make it live

**Cursor**

Reviewing the project structure and current state to identify what's needed to go live.


Checking deployment status and what's needed to go live.


Checking the environment configuration and website status.


Checking deployment scripts and contract status.


Status summary:
- Arbitrum: live at `0x5c0156da501BC97DD35017Fb20624B7f1Ce7E095`
- Ethereum: not deployed
- Base: not deployed
- Website: builds successfully; configured for Arbitrum; ready for GitHub Pages
- Tests: 60/64 passing (4 failures due to ethers v6 test setup)

What’s needed to go live:
- Deploy contracts to Ethereum and Base
- Update website config with new addresses
- Deploy website to GitHub Pages
- Fix the 4 failing tests (ethers v6 compatibility)


Deploy Base first (cheapest):
```bash
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network base
```
Cost: ~0.001–0.005 ETH

Deploy Ethereum mainnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network ethereum
```
Cost: ~0.1–0.3 ETH

Update website config:
```bash
# After Base deployment
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local

# After Ethereum deployment  
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_ETH_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local
```

Deploy website:
```bash
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website
npm run deploy
```

Verify contracts:
```bash
# Base verification
npx hardhat verify --network base 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS "0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"

# Ethereum verification
npx hardhat verify --network ethereum 0xYOUR_ETH_ADDRESS "0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"
```

Prerequisites:
- Ensure deployer wallet has ETH:
  - Ethereum: ~0.5 ETH
  - Base: ~0.01 ETH
- API keys are configured (ANKR_API_KEY, ETHERSCAN_API_KEY, etc.)

Estimated total cost: ~0.1–0.3 ETH (mostly Ethereum deployment)

Timeline:
- Base: ~5 minutes
- Ethereum: ~10 minutes
- Website: ~5 minutes
- Verification: ~10 minutes
Total: ~30 minutes

Security:
- Contracts are immutable and non-upgradeable
- 60/64 tests passing
- Gas-optimized
- Security features implemented

Should I proceed with the Base deployment?


```shellscript
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network base
```

```shellscript
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network ethereum
```

```shellscript
# After Base deployment
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local

# After Ethereum deployment  
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_ETH_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local
```

```shellscript
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website
npm run deploy
```

```shellscript
# Base verification
npx hardhat verify --network base 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS "0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"

# Ethereum verification
npx hardhat verify --network ethereum 0xYOUR_ETH_ADDRESS "0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS"
```

I will do ETH in the morning as gas will be cheaper... but base gives this...

Investigating the Base deployment error: "Origin not allowed" indicates an RPC issue. Checking the RPC configuration and fixing it.


ANKR RPC is rejecting requests due to origin restrictions. Switching to a Base RPC endpoint that doesn’t enforce origin checks.


Base mainnet RPC works. Updating `hardhat.config.js` to use it.

Checking Base deployment balance:


Base balance is 0.0028 ETH; deployment needs ~0.01 ETH. Funding the deployer wallet (~0.01 ETH) on Base.


## Base deployment issue fixed

**Problem:** ANKR RPC rejected requests with "Origin not allowed".

**Solution:** Updated `hardhat.config.js` to use Base mainnet RPC: `https://mainnet.base.org`.

## Next steps

### 1. Fund Base wallet
Current balance: **0.0028 ETH**  
Required: **~0.01 ETH**  
Need to add: **~0.007 ETH**

Send ETH to: `0x3CD6BbF16599Af7FDe6F4b7C8b6FD6Bea4EDc191`

### 2. Deploy to Base
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network base
```

### 3. Update website configuration
```bash
# Replace 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS with the deployed address
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local
```

### 4. Verify contract
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network base 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS "0x3CD6BbF16599Af7FDe6F4b7C8b6FD6Bea4EDc191"
```

## Status summary

- Arbitrum: Live at `0x5c0156da501BC97DD35017Fb20624B7f1Ce7E095`
- Base: Ready to deploy (needs ~0.007 ETH funding)
- Ethereum: Deploy tomorrow when gas is cheaper
- Website: Ready for multi-chain deployment

Once funded, Base deployment should complete in ~5 minutes.

```shellscript
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network base
```

```shellscript
# Replace 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS with the deployed address
sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=.*/NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS/' /home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/.env.local
```

```shellscript
npx hardhat verify --network base 0xYOUR_BASE_ADDRESS "0x3CD6BbF16599Af7FDe6F4b7C8b6FD6Bea4EDc191"
```

Deployment succeeded at `0xBDcC71d5F73962d017756A04919FBba9d30F0795`, but verification failed due to a contract call error. Investigating and fixing.


Verifying the deployed contract directly:


Verification failed due to a deprecated Etherscan API. Checking the deployed contract directly and updating the website configuration.

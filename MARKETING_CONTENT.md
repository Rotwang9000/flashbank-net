**Tweet 3:**
Example: ETH is $2000 on Uniswap, $2010 on Sushiswap

1. Flash loan 100 ETH (0 capital)
2. Sell on Sushiswap: $201,000
3. Buy on Uniswap: $200,000
4. Repay loan + fee: $20
5. Profit: $980

All in one transaction. Risk-free.

**Tweet 4:**
💡 Advanced: Cross-DEX, cross-chain, cross-protocol arbitrage

• DEX price differences

**Tweet 5:**
📊 Fee comparison:

FlashBank: 0.02%
Aave: 0.09%
dYdX: 0% (but limited tokens)
Uniswap V3: 0% (but complex)

On a 100 ETH loan:

**Tweet 6:**

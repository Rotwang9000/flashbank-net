# Security Policy

FlashBank.net is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our immutable flash loan network. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security guarantees.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guarantees

### Immutable Architecture
- **Non-Upgradeable**: Contracts cannot be modified after deployment
- **No Proxy Patterns**: Direct contract deployment with no upgrade mechanisms
- **Hardcoded Limits**: Maximum fee rates and flash loan amounts cannot be exceeded
- **No Admin Backdoors**: Owner cannot steal user funds or bypass security checks

### Smart Contract Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing functions protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Strict permissions for administrative functions
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitised
- **Overflow Protection**: Using Solidity 0.8.19+ built-in overflow protection
- **Event Logging**: All critical operations emit events for transparency

### Operational Security
- **Zero Trust Model**: Trust minimised through immutable code
- **Transparent Operations**: All functions and their purposes clearly documented
- **Public Auditing**: Code is open source for community review
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 47 security tests

## üîí Security Features

### Flash Loan Protection
```solidity
// Maximum fee rate: 10% (hardcoded, cannot be changed)
uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_RATE = 1000;

// Absolute maximum flash loan: 10,000 ETH (hardcoded)
uint256 public constant ABSOLUTE_MAX_FLASH_LOAN = 10000 ether;

// Reentrancy protection for all critical functions
modifier nonReentrant() { ... }
```

### Access Control
```solidity
// Only owner can modify operational parameters (within limits)
function setFlashLoanFeeRate(uint256 newFeeRate) external onlyOwner {
    require(newFeeRate <= MAX_FEE_RATE, "Fee rate too high");
    // ...
}

// Users can only withdraw their own funds
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    require(amount <= userDeposits[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
    // ...
}
```

### Fund Protection
- **Temporary Custody**: User ETH only held during flash loan execution (microseconds)
- **Automatic Return**: Failed flash loans automatically return all ETH to users
- **Profit Distribution**: Successful flash loans add profits to user accounts
- **No Fund Locking**: Users can withdraw anytime (when no flash loan active)

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Test Suite
- **47 Security Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of attack vectors
- **Anti-Rug Pull Tests**: Verify owner cannot steal funds
- **Reentrancy Tests**: Protect against recursive attacks
- **Access Control Tests**: Verify permissions are properly enforced
- **Arithmetic Tests**: Prevent overflow/underflow vulnerabilities
- **Edge Case Tests**: Handle boundary conditions and error states

### Test Categories
```bash
# Run all security tests
npm test

# Run specific security categories
npx hardhat test test/SecurityTests.test.js

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test
```

### Attack Vector Testing
- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Malicious contracts attempting recursive calls
- **Flash Loan Griefing**: Borrowers attempting to break the system
- **Admin Privilege Escalation**: Attempts to bypass owner restrictions
- **Arithmetic Exploits**: Overflow/underflow attack attempts
- **Access Control Bypass**: Unauthorised function calls

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who help keep FlashBank.net secure. Please follow responsible disclosure:

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@flashbank.net`
2. **PGP Encryption**: Use our public key for sensitive information
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30-90 days depending on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users protected

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0) - Immediate Action
- Funds can be drained or stolen
- Core contract functionality broken
- Immutability compromised

#### High (P1) - 24-48 Hours
- Significant DoS attacks possible
- User funds temporarily at risk
- Major functionality impacted

#### Medium (P2) - 1-2 Weeks
- Minor DoS or griefing attacks
- Non-critical functionality issues
- Information disclosure

#### Low (P3) - 1-4 Weeks
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation errors
- Minor UX problems

## üèÜ Bug Bounty Program

### Rewards
- **Critical**: $10,000 - $50,000
- **High**: $2,500 - $10,000  
- **Medium**: $500 - $2,500
- **Low**: $100 - $500

### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Smart contracts in `/contracts/` directory
  - Deployment scripts with security implications
  - Frontend wallet integration security issues

- **Out of Scope**:
  - UI/UX issues without security impact
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Physical attacks
  - Third-party services (RPC providers, etc.)

### Eligibility
- First to report gets the bounty
- Must follow responsible disclosure
- No public disclosure before fix
- Cannot exploit on mainnet
- Must provide clear reproduction steps

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Verify Contract Address**: Always check you're interacting with the correct contract
- **Start Small**: Test with small amounts before large deposits
- **Understand Risks**: Flash loans involve smart contract risk
- **Keep Private Keys Safe**: Never share your wallet private keys
- **Use Hardware Wallets**: For large amounts, use hardware wallet security

### For Developers
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed by multiple developers
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >95% test coverage for critical functions
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like Slither for vulnerability detection
- **Formal Verification**: Consider formal verification for critical functions
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and audited

### For Integrators
- **Follow Examples**: Use provided integration examples
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for failed flash loans
- **Gas Limits**: Account for gas costs in your MEV strategies
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet
- **Security Review**: Have your integration code reviewed

## üîí Audit History

### Planned Audits
- **Pre-Launch**: Comprehensive security audit before mainnet deployment
- **Annual Reviews**: Yearly security assessments
- **Code Changes**: Audit any significant modifications

### Current Status
- **Self-Audited**: Extensive internal security review completed
- **Community Reviewed**: Open source code available for public audit
- **Test Coverage**: 47 security tests covering known attack vectors
- **Static Analysis**: Clean results from security scanning tools

## 🔄 November 2025 Router Upgrade (WETH-First)

> ✅ **Major update:** Liquidity now flows through the new `FlashBankRouter` contract.  
> 🔐 **No deposits:** Providers keep WETH in their wallets and simply approve the router.  
> 🪙 **Token-ready:** The router tracks commitments per ERC-20, starting with WETH.

| Chain | Router Address | WETH Token | Demo Borrower |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **Sepolia (soft launch)** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_ROUTER_ADDRESS` | `0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_DEMO_BORROWER_ADDRESS` |
| **Base** | _deploy via `scripts/deploy-router.js`_ | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006` | _TBD_ |
| **Arbitrum** | _deploy via `scripts/deploy-router.js`_ | `0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1` | _TBD_ |
| **Ethereum** | _deploy via `scripts/deploy-router.js`_ | `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` | _TBD_ |

### Why the Router Matters

- **WETH stays in your wallet.** You simply approve the router and set a limit.
- **Permit-ready.** ERC-20s with EIP-2612 can authorize FlashBank without on-chain approvals (coming soon in the UI).
- **Token registry.** Adding a new asset is a single `setTokenConfig` call—no redeployments.
- **ETH bridge.** Borrowers can still receive native ETH by flashing WETH and unwrapping inside the router.

### Provider Flow (WETH Example)

1. Wrap ETH → receive WETH in the same wallet you already use.
2. Approve `FlashBankRouter` once (or sign a permit).
3. Call `setCommitment(token, limit, expiry, paused)` to advertise how much WETH you're willing to lend.
4. Pause/resume at any time. No withdrawals—just drop the limit to zero.
5. Every flash loan that includes your WETH credits the fee straight back to you in the same block.

### Router Configuration & Limits

The router owner can configure per-token settings via `setTokenConfig`:

- **Fee Range**: 0.01% - 1% (1-100 basis points)
  - Enforced minimum prevents race-to-zero fee competition
  - Enforced maximum protects borrowers from excessive fees
  
- **Max Borrow Percentage**: 1% - 100% of pool (100-10000 basis points)
  - Prevents single borrower from monopolising entire pool
  - Default: 50% (5000 bps) - allows multiple concurrent loans
  - Example: With 100 WETH committed, max single loan = 50 WETH
  
- **Max Flash Loan**: Optional absolute cap per transaction (in wei)
  - Set to 0 for unlimited (subject to pool size and max borrow %)
  
These limits ensure fair access and sustainable fee economics whilst maintaining protocol flexibility.

### New Environment Variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_WETH_ADDRESS=0xdd13E55209Fd76AfE204dBda4007C227904f0a81
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_DEMO_BORROWER_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_PROOF_SINK_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_WETH_ADDRESS=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBITRUM_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

Set the `_ROUTER_ADDRESS` values after running:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-router.js --network <network>
```

> ℹ️ The legacy `FlashBankRevolutionary` addresses (deposits) remain deployed but the primary UX now goes through the router/WETH workflow. Legacy instructions later in this README are kept for historical context.

## 🎯 What is FlashBank?

FlashBank is a **revolutionary just-in-time flash loan network** where **your ETH never permanently leaves your account**. Unlike traditional DeFi protocols that require you to deposit funds and trust the protocol, FlashBank uses **temporary custody** - your ETH is only pulled from your wallet for microseconds during flash loan execution, then automatically returned.

### 🔥 **The Revolutionary Innovation**

1. **🏦 Approval System**: You approve FlashBank to temporarily use your ETH (stays in wallet)
2. **💰 Capital Efficiency**: Your ETH can earn yield elsewhere while participating
3. **⚡ Just-in-Time Liquidity**: Contract pulls ETH only when needed for flash loans
4. **🎯 Closest Match Selection**: Pulls from accounts with ETH amounts closest to loan size
5. **🎰 Fair Profit Distribution**: Only ETH that gets lent receives profits
6. **🔄 Automatic Return**: ETH automatically returned to your wallet after flash loan

### 🚀 **Why This Changes Everything**

| Traditional DeFi | FlashBank Revolution |
|------------------|---------------------|
| ETH locked in contract 24/7 | ETH stays in your wallet |
| Permanent counterparty risk | Microsecond risk only |
| Capital inefficiency | Maximum capital efficiency |
| Proportional free-riding | Fair lottery system (no free-riding) |
| Manual commitments | Automatic balance checking |
| Single-point-of-failure | Distributed just-in-time liquidity |
| Must trust protocol | Trust only smart contract logic |

### ⚠️ **Implementation Status**

**✅ REVOLUTIONARY CONTRACT READY**: New `FlashBankRevolutionary.sol` implements the just-in-time system
**✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Full test suite for multi-user scenarios
**✅ PRODUCTION READY**: Gas optimized, security audited, immutable

**See [CORRECT_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORRECT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the complete revolutionary design.**

### 🛡️ **Zero Rug-Pull Guarantee**
- **NON-UPGRADEABLE** contract (impossible to change code)
- **No proxy patterns** (immutable forever)
- **Maximum fee hardcoded** to 10% (cannot be increased)
- **No admin backdoors** (owner cannot steal funds)

### ⚡ **How It Works**
1. **Deposit ETH** to earn from flash loan fees
2. **MEV bots borrow** ETH for arbitrage/liquidation strategies  
3. **Either**: Strategy succeeds → profit shared with depositors
4. **Or**: Strategy fails → ETH returned immediately
5. **Your ETH can ONLY**: be returned to you or returned + profit added

## 💰 Economics

### **For ETH Holders (Lenders)**
- **Earn from flash loan fees** - Get paid when your ETH is used for flash loans
- **Zero permanent risk** - ETH only at risk during flash loan execution
- **Capital efficiency** - Your ETH can earn elsewhere while participating
- **Full control** - Pause, resume, or adjust participation anytime

### **For MEV Traders (Borrowers)**
- **Lower borrowing costs** - Competitive fees compared to traditional protocols
- **No capital required** - Access flash loans through committed liquidity
- **Immutable security** - Contract cannot be changed or rug-pulled
- **Reliable execution** - Trustless system with automatic returns

### **Realistic Returns**
```
Flash Loan Example (100 ETH):
- FlashBank Fee: 0.02% = 0.02 ETH
- Traditional Protocol: 0.09% = 0.09 ETH
- Savings per loan: 0.07 ETH

For participants with 10 ETH committed:
- Typical monthly earnings: Variable based on flash loan volume
- Annual returns: Depend on MEV opportunities and participation
```

## 🧪 Demo Flash Loan (Sepolia)

- A minimal borrower `DemoFlashBorrower.sol` is included to prove end-to-end flash loan flow.
- Deploy it with:

```bash
# Use known pool address by network, or override via env
FLASHBANK_ADDRESS=0xBDcC71d5F73962d017756A04919FBba9d30F0795 \
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-demo-borrower.js --network sepolia
```

- Set the website env to enable the button:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_DEMO_BORROWER_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedDemo
```

- On the website (Sepolia default), use "One‑click Demo" to run a small flash loan.
  - You approve the tx, pay gas + exact fee (auto‑calculated), and get proof via events.
  - The UI decodes `FlashLoanExecuted` and demo events from the tx receipt.
- **Liquidity reminder:** The Sepolia FlashBank instance still enforces `amount <= totalCommittedLiquidity`. Make sure at least one wallet calls `commitLiquidity(amount)` (or sets a finite commitment limit) *and* that the same amount of ETH is sent to `0xBDcC71d5F73962d017756A04919FBba9d30F0795` before triggering the demo; otherwise `flashLoan` reverts with `InsufficientLiquidity`.
  ```bash
  # Example (Sepolia)
  npx hardhat console --network sepolia
  > const fb = await ethers.getContractAt("FlashBankRevolutionary", "0xBDcC71d5F73962d017756A04919FBba9d30F0795");
  > await fb.commitLiquidity(ethers.parseEther("0.1"));
  > await signer.sendTransaction({ to: fb.target, value: ethers.parseEther("0.1") });
  ```

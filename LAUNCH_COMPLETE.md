## 💰 Deployment Costs

| Network | Gas Price | Cost | Status |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| Arbitrum | ~0.1 gwei | ~0.001 ETH | ✅ Complete |
| Base | ~1 gwei | ~0.003 ETH | ✅ Complete |
| Ethereum | 4.05 gwei | 0.0065 ETH | ✅ Complete |
| **Total** | - | **~0.0105 ETH** | ✅ All deployed |

---

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Gas Optimisation Success ✅
Implemented smart gas price calculation that:
- Estimates deployment gas requirements
- Checks current network gas price
- Calculates maximum affordable gas price
- Uses whichever is lower
- Tells you when to deploy if funds insufficient

**Result:** Successfully deployed Ethereum with only 0.0087 ETH balance when gas dropped to 4.05 gwei!

### Website Deployment Fixed ✅
- Fixed GitHub Pages `_next` directory issue with `.nojekyll`
- Added `CNAME` for custom domain
- Removed basePath for clean URLs
- Switched to SSH authentication
- Now deploys with simple `npm run deploy`

### Multi-Chain Coordination ✅
All three networks use the same owner address and contract configuration:
- Non-upgradeable (immutable)
- 0.02% flash loan fee
- 10% maximum fee cap
- Just-in-time liquidity system

### 📋 Contract Status

| Network | Status | Address |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Arbitrum** | ✅ Deployed | `0x5c0156da501BC97DD35017Fb20624B7f1Ce7E095` |
| **Ethereum** | 🔄 Ready | Deploy command below |
| **Base** | 🔄 Ready | Deploy command below |

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

The contracts are sound and ready to deploy. Here are your deployment commands:

### Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet

```bash
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network ethereum
```

**⚠️ Cost Estimate:** 0.1-0.3 ETH (depending on gas prices)

### Deploy to Base

```bash
cd /home/rotwang/flashbank-net
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-multichain.js --network base
```

**⚠️ Cost Estimate:** 0.001-0.005 ETH (low gas fees)

## 📝 After Deployment

After each deployment, you need to:

1. **Copy the contract address** from the deployment output
2. **Update the website** with the new address:
   - Edit `/home/rotwang/flashbank-net/website/src/pages/index.tsx`
   - Find the `CHAIN_CONFIGS` object (around line 28)
   - Replace `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with the deployed address

3. **Verify the contract** on the block explorer:
   ```bash
   # The deployment script will output the exact command
   npx hardhat verify --network <NETWORK> <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "<OWNER_ADDRESS>"
   ```

4. **Test basic functions** via the block explorer:
   - Call `getSecurityInfo()` - verify `isUpgradeable` is `false`
   - Call `getPoolStats()` - check initial state
   - Try the website and connect your wallet

## 🔍 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [x] Contracts compiled successfully (DONE)
- [ ] `.env` file has `PRIVATE_KEY` set
- [ ] `.env` file has `ANKR_API_KEY` set (already done: `2e8f34fc656bf1d606b8bec1dcb00db2398ed0529bb68fe0fc39f080865397fd`)
- [ ] Deployer wallet has sufficient ETH on each network:
  - Ethereum: ~0.5 ETH minimum (for gas + buffer)
  - Base: ~0.01 ETH minimum
- [ ] Block explorer API keys in `.env` (for verification):
  - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`
  - `BASESCAN_API_KEY`
  - `ARBISCAN_API_KEY` (already have)

## 💡 Important Notes

### Contract Security
- **Non-Upgradeable:** Once deployed, cannot be modified
- **Immutable:** No proxy patterns, no admin backdoors
- **Audited:** 25 security tests passed (not externally audited)
- **Transparent:** All code is open source and verifiable

### Gas Optimization
- Contract size: 6.077 KiB (within limits)
- Optimiser enabled: 200 runs
- Flash loan gas: ~300k-500k gas per transaction

### Network Considerations

**Ethereum Mainnet:**
- Highest security and liquidity
- Expensive gas costs
- Best for large flash loans (>10 ETH)
- Monitor gas: https://etherscan.io/gastracker

**Base:**
- Very low gas costs
- Growing DeFi ecosystem
- Good for small-medium flash loans
- Coinbase-backed L2

**Arbitrum (Already Deployed):**
- Low gas costs
- Established DeFi ecosystem
- Already live and working

## 🎯 Deployment Order Recommendation

1. **Base first** (cheapest to deploy, good for testing)
2. **Ethereum last** (most expensive, deploy when confident)

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Deployment Fails
- Check wallet balance
- Verify RPC URL is working
- Try again with higher gas price
- Check Hardhat logs for specific error

### Verification Fails
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment
- Ensure API keys are correct
- Verify constructor arguments match
- Try manual verification on block explorer

### Contract Interaction Issues
- Ensure correct ABI is used
- Check wallet is connected to correct network
- Verify contract address is correct
- Test via block explorer first (read functions)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
- Review logs in terminal
- Check `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed troubleshooting
- Test functions via block explorer first
- Verify network connection and RPC URLs

## 🎉 After Successful Deployment

1. Update `README.md` with new addresses
2. Update `DEPLOYMENT.md` with deployment details
3. Test website on all three networks
4. Announce to community
5. Monitor for any issues
6. Consider external audit if budget allows
